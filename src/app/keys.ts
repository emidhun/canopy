/* The keybinding registry.

   Every global shortcut is declared here once, with a default, and the keydown
   handler matches against the registry rather than a chain of hardcoded `if
   (meta && e.key === "b")` branches. That is what makes remapping possible at
   all — without a registry there is nothing to remap, and the Shortcuts page
   can only be a static list that drifts from the code the moment either
   changes.

   Overrides live in `Settings.keybindings` (a map of action id → binding), so
   they travel with the config file like every other preference and are visible
   to the popover window. */
