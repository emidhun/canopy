// OS notifications and the app-icon badge.
//
// Every event routed through here already appears in the in-app attention
// queue. A notification exists for the case the queue cannot cover: Canopy is
// in the tray and you are looking at something else.
//
// That framing sets the defaults. Notify when a human is BLOCKING something —
// a crashed service, an agent waiting on an answer — and stay quiet for
// progress you asked for and can watch. `setup_done` and `branch_moved` are
// off by default for exactly that reason.
//
// Two guards keep this from becoming noise:
//   - nothing fires while a Canopy window is on screen; the pip, the queue and
//     the toast have already told you
//   - the same subject can't re-notify inside a cooldown, so a service that
//     crash-loops produces one notification, not forty
