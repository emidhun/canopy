// Per-worktree on-disk footprint, for the overview's Size column.
//
// The column answers one question: "what would I reclaim by removing this?"
// That framing settles the two design decisions this module has to make.
//
// 1. WHAT IS COUNTED — everything under the worktree root, `node_modules` and
//    build output included. Those are the bulk of the footprint and they *are*
//    freed by removal, so excluding them would answer a question nobody asked.
//    Ignored-by-git is irrelevant here; git has no opinion about disk.
//
// 2. WHEN IT RUNS — never on the UI path. A recursive walk of a few
//    `node_modules` trees is hundreds of thousands of `stat` calls; making the
//    overview await that would freeze it on open. So scans run on the blocking
//    pool, one at a time, and publish `worktree:disk` when each finishes. The
//    overview renders "—" until a result arrives and never blocks on one.
