# User Guide

A task-oriented walkthrough of using Canopy day to day. For a reference of every control, see
[features.md](features.md); for the config file formats, see [configuration.md](configuration.md).

---

## 1. Install and launch

Follow the install steps in the [README](../README.md#install-users) (or
[distribution.md](distribution.md) for the details). Once installed, launch **Canopy** — it runs as a
**menu-bar app**, so it has no dock icon; look for its mark in the macOS menu bar.

Click the menu-bar icon to open the **popover**. From there:

- **Open Manager** — opens the main window (where you do most things).
- **Quit** — stops all services Canopy started and exits.

---

## 2. Add a repo

1. Open the main window → **Settings** (gear, top-right).
2. **Add repo** → pick the folder of your repo's **main checkout** (the normal clone, not a worktree).
3. Set:
   - **Name** — display name.
   - **Worktree directory** — where new worktrees are created (e.g. `<repo>/.worktrees`).
   - **Reset-DB command** and **Migrate command** (optional) — used by the database menu.
4. Define **services** — one row each. For example, a web frontend and an API server:

   | id | name | kind | command | cwd | basePort |
   |----|------|------|---------|-----|----------|
   | `frontend` | Frontend | web | `npm start -- --port $PORT` | `frontend` | 8082 |
   | `server` | Server | server | `npm run start:dev` | `server` | 3000 |

   - Reference **`$PORT`** in a service's command to bind it to the per-worktree port Canopy assigns.
   - To point one service at another (e.g. frontend → server), use **`$WM_PORT_<SERVICE>`** or
     **`$WT_<SERVICE>_PORT`** (e.g. `$WT_SERVER_PORT`). Both work in service commands.

5. (Optional) Add **Custom commands** (`{label, command}`) — they appear as buttons/menu items in the
   worktree header and run in the worktree root.

Saving writes your app settings **and** the repo's `.worktreemanager.json` (env overrides + setup
commands — see next step).

---

## 3. Tell Canopy how to provision a worktree

Provisioning (what runs when a worktree is created) is declared **in the repo** so it travels with the
branch. Commit a `.worktreemanager.json` at the repo root:

```jsonc
{
  "env": {                                    // add-or-replace keys in the worktree's .env
    "PG_DB": "${WT_DB_NAME}",                 // isolated database name
    "PORT": "${WT_SERVER_PORT}",
    "TOOLJET_SERVER_PORT": "${WT_SERVER_PORT}"
  },
  "setup":    [ "npm --prefix server install", "npm run db:create && npm run db:migrate" ],
  "migrate":  [ "npm run db:migrate" ],        // run by "Run migration"
  "teardown": [ "npm run db:drop" ]            // run on remove when "Drop database" is checked
}
```

`${VAR}` tokens in `env` values and `$VAR` in commands are interpolated with the worktree's variables
(`${WT_DB_NAME}`, `${WT_SERVER_PORT}`, `$WT_PATH`, …). The full list is in
[configuration.md](configuration.md#variables-available-to-provisioning). A complete ToolJet example
is in [tooljet-config.md](tooljet-config.md).

> Canopy looks for the config in the **worktree first**, then the **main checkout** — so an
> uncommitted copy in main works as a fallback while you iterate, and committing it makes it travel
> per branch.

---

## 4. Create a worktree

1. Main window → **New worktree**.
2. Pick the **repository**.
3. Choose one:
   - **New branch** — enter a branch name, then pick a **base** (branch or tag) to fork from.
   - **Existing branch / tag** — search and pick a local branch, a remote branch (a local tracking
     branch is created), or a **tag** (a local branch is created from it).
   - **Fetch all** refreshes remote branches and tags first (`git fetch --all --prune`).
4. **Create worktree**. Canopy runs `git worktree add`, initializes submodules, applies your `env`
   overrides, and runs the `setup` commands — streaming progress live.

The new worktree appears in the sidebar and becomes active.

---

## 5. Run services

- **Start all / Stop all** — the primary button in the worktree header boots or stops every service.
- **Per service** (in the Services section) — hover a row for a **power** button to start/stop just
  that one.
- **Open in browser** — click a service's **port** (`:3000`) to open `localhost:<port>`. In the
  popover, the **globe** icon does the same for the web service.
- **Logs** — the panel at the bottom has a tab per service plus **All** (merged, time-ordered,
  `[service]`-tagged). Auto-scroll pauses when you scroll up; **Clear** empties the active tab.

### Changing a port

In a service row, hover the port and click **✎**. Enter a new port — Canopy validates it, re-derives
any dependent env keys, and auto-restarts the service. Overrides persist per service.

---

## 6. Manage databases

Each worktree has its own database. In the **Database** section:

- **`db_name ▾` picker** — searchable list of all databases on the server; pick one to **switch**
  (rewrites `PG_DB` and restarts the server).
- **`⋯` actions menu**:
  - **Run migration** — runs the repo's migrate command.
  - **Save snapshot…** — clones the current DB to a named copy (default `<db>_snap_<timestamp>`).
  - **Export to file…** — `pg_dump` to a `.dump` you choose.
  - **Restore from file…** — restore a `.dump`/`.backup` (via `pg_restore --clean`) or a `.sql`
    (via `psql`) **into the current database**.
  - **Reset database** — destructive; runs the repo's reset command.

> Snapshots/exports/restores use Postgres binaries matching your **server's major version**; make sure
> the matching Postgres version is installed (see the `pg_dump` note in
> [development.md](development.md#gotchas-that-have-bitten-us-read-before-debugging)).

---

## 7. Keep a worktree up to date

Use **Pull** (in the worktree header status line) to `git pull --ff-only` and **advance submodules**:
each submodule is pulled if it's on a branch, updated to its pinned branch tip if `.gitmodules` tracks
one, or synced to the recorded commit otherwise. The toast reports a summary (e.g.
`✓ pulled, 2 submodule(s) pulled`).

---

## 8. Remove a worktree

Worktree header **⋯** → **Remove worktree**. In the confirm dialog:

- A **dirty precheck** warns if the worktree (or a submodule) has uncommitted changes.
- **Also delete branch** (off by default).
- **Drop database** (on by default) — runs your `teardown` before deletion.

Canopy stops the services, runs teardown, removes the worktree, optionally deletes the branch, and
prunes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| App won't open ("damaged" / "unverified") | Quarantine — run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Canopy.app` (see [Install](../README.md#install-users)). |
| `setup` fails with `notsup` / wrong Node | The project needs a newer Node than your default. Canopy uses the worktree's pinned Node (`.tool-versions`/`.nvmrc`); make sure that version is installed. |
| Server can't find `@tooljet/plugins/dist/server` | Plugins must be built per worktree — add `npm --prefix plugins install && npm --prefix plugins run build` to `setup`. |
| Frontend hits the wrong API port | The frontend bakes the server URL from `TOOLJET_SERVER_PORT` at launch — set it in `env` to `${WT_SERVER_PORT}`, and give the frontend `--port $PORT`. |
| Snapshot/export/restore fails on version | Install the Postgres version matching your server's major version. |
| A service shows as stopped but a port is in use | Another worktree (or a stale process) holds the port. Stop the other worktree, or edit this service's port. |
