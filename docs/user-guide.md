# User Guide

A task-oriented walkthrough of using Canopod day to day. For a reference of every control, see
[features.md](features.md); for the config file formats, see [configuration.md](configuration.md).

---

## 1. Install and launch

**Quickest:** `brew install --cask emidhun/canopod/canopod` — or grab the
[macOS DMG](https://github.com/emidhun/canopod/releases/download/v0.5.0/Canopod_0.5.0_aarch64.dmg)
/ [Linux packages](https://github.com/emidhun/canopod/releases) directly.
Full steps in the [README](../README.md#install) (or
[distribution.md](distribution.md) for the details). Once installed, launch **Canopod** — it runs as a
**menu-bar app**, so it has no dock icon; look for its mark in the macOS menu bar.

Click the menu-bar icon to open the **popover**. From there:

- **Open Manager** — opens the main window (where you do most things).
- **Quit** — stops all services Canopod started and exits.

---

## 2. Add a repo

1. Open the main window → **Settings** (gear, top-right).
2. **Add repo** → pick the folder of your repo's **main checkout** (the normal clone, not a worktree).
3. Set:
   - **Name** — display name.
   - **Worktree directory** — where new worktrees are created (e.g. `<repo>/.worktrees`).
   - **Reset-DB command** and **Migrate command** (optional) — used by the database menu.
4. Define **services** — one row each. For example, a web frontend and an API server:

   | id | name | kind | command | cwd | basePort |
   |----|------|------|---------|-----|----------|
   | `frontend` | Frontend | web | `npm start -- --port $PORT` | `frontend` | 8082 |
   | `server` | Server | server | `npm run start:dev` | `server` | 3000 |

   - Reference **`$PORT`** in a service's command to bind it to the per-worktree port Canopod assigns.
   - To point one service at another (e.g. frontend → server), use **`$WM_PORT_<SERVICE>`** or
     **`$WT_<SERVICE>_PORT`** (e.g. `$WT_SERVER_PORT`). Both work in service commands.

5. (Optional) Add **Custom commands** (`{label, command}`) — they appear as buttons/menu items in the
   worktree header and run in the worktree root.

Saving writes your app settings **and** the repo's `.worktreemanager.json` (env overrides + setup
commands — see next step).

---

## 3. Tell Canopod how to provision a worktree

Provisioning (what runs when a worktree is created) is declared **in the repo** so it travels with the
branch. Commit a `.worktreemanager.json` at the repo root:

```jsonc
{
  "env": {                                    // add-or-replace keys in the worktree's .env
    "PG_DB": "${WT_DB_NAME}",                 // isolated database name
    "PORT": "${WT_SERVER_PORT}",
    "TOOLJET_SERVER_PORT": "${WT_SERVER_PORT}"
  },
  "setup":    [ "npm --prefix server install", "npm run db:create && npm run db:migrate" ],
  "migrate":  [ "npm run db:migrate" ],        // run by "Run migration"
  "teardown": [ "npm run db:drop" ]            // run on remove when "Drop database" is checked
}
```

`${VAR}` tokens in `env` values and `$VAR` in commands are interpolated with the worktree's variables
(`${WT_DB_NAME}`, `${WT_SERVER_PORT}`, `$WT_PATH`, …). The full list is in
[configuration.md](configuration.md#variables-available-to-provisioning). A complete ToolJet example
is in [tooljet-config.md](tooljet-config.md).

> Canopod looks for the config in the **worktree first**, then the **main checkout** — so an
> uncommitted copy in main works as a fallback while you iterate, and committing it makes it travel
> per branch.

---

## 4. Create a worktree

1. Main window → **New worktree**.
2. Pick the **repository**.
3. Choose one:
   - **New branch** — enter a branch name, then pick a **base** (branch or tag) to fork from.
   - **Existing branch / tag** — search and pick a local branch, a remote branch (a local tracking
     branch is created), or a **tag** (a local branch is created from it).
   - **Fetch all** refreshes remote branches and tags first (`git fetch --all --prune`).
4. **Create worktree**. Canopod runs `git worktree add`, initializes submodules, applies your `env`
   overrides, and runs the `setup` commands — streaming progress live.

The new worktree appears in the sidebar and becomes active.

---

## 4.1 Sync worktrees created by another agent

If another agent or terminal runs `git worktree add` for a repository already registered in Canopod,
click **Sync external worktrees** in the top bar or run it from the `⌘K` command palette. Canopod asks
Git for the repository's registered worktrees, refreshes the sidebar, and reports what it added.

Sync imports only entries returned by `git worktree list`; it does not scan arbitrary copied folders
or add unrelated repositories. It also detects worktree registrations whose directories were deleted
outside Canopod and offers to prune the stale Git entries, with optional branch and database cleanup.

### Updates and project reminders

Under **Settings → General**, Canopod checks GitHub at most once per day and sends a native notification
only when a newer release exists. **Install updates automatically** is opt-in: downloaded bundles are
verified with Canopod's updater signing key before installation and the app restarts cleanly. Use
**Check now** for the same flow on demand.

The separate **Daily GitHub star reminder** sends at most one notification per 24 hours and can be
disabled at any time. It does not contact GitHub; only opening the project page does.

---

## 5. Run services

- **Start all / Stop all** — the primary button in the worktree header boots or stops every service.
- **Per service** (in the Services section) — hover a row for a **power** button to start/stop just
  that one.
- **Open in browser** — click a service's **port** (`:3000`) to open `localhost:<port>`. In the
  popover, the **globe** icon does the same for the web service.
- **Logs** — the panel at the bottom has a tab per service plus **All** (merged, time-ordered,
  `[service]`-tagged). Auto-scroll pauses when you scroll up; **Clear** empties the active tab.

### Changing a port

Open the service details from its chip in the service rail. Enter a new port and choose
**Save & restart** — Canopod validates it, re-derives dependent env keys, and restarts the
worktree’s running services. Overrides persist per service. **Reset to default** removes the
saved override, reapplies the derived `basePort + index × 10` port, and restarts running services;
future base-port changes then apply automatically. A conflicting default is rejected.

---

## 6. Manage databases

Each worktree has its own database. In the **Database** section:

- **`db_name ▾` picker** — searchable list of all databases on the server; pick one to **switch**
  (rewrites `PG_DB` and restarts the server).
- **`⋯` actions menu**:
  - **Run migration** — runs the repo's migrate command.
  - **Save snapshot…** — clones the current DB to a named copy (default `<db>_snap_<timestamp>`).
  - **Export to file…** — `pg_dump` to a `.dump` you choose.
  - **Restore from file…** — restore a `.dump`/`.backup` (via `pg_restore --clean`) or a `.sql`
    (via `psql`) **into the current database**.
  - **Reset database** — destructive; runs the repo's reset command.

> Snapshots/exports/restores use Postgres binaries matching your **server's major version**; make sure
> the matching Postgres version is installed (see the `pg_dump` note in
> [development.md](development.md#gotchas-that-have-bitten-us-read-before-debugging)).

---

## 7. Keep a worktree up to date

Use **Pull** (in the worktree header status line) to `git pull --ff-only` and **advance submodules**:
each submodule is pulled if it's on a branch, updated to its pinned branch tip if `.gitmodules` tracks
one, or synced to the recorded commit otherwise. The toast reports a summary (e.g.
`✓ pulled, 2 submodule(s) pulled`).

---

## 8. Remove a worktree

Worktree header **⋯** → **Remove worktree**. In the confirm dialog:

- A **dirty precheck** warns if the worktree (or a submodule) has uncommitted changes.
- **Also delete branch** (off by default).
- **Drop database** (on by default) — runs your `teardown` before deletion.

Canopod stops the services, runs teardown, removes the worktree, optionally deletes the branch, and
prunes.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| App won't open ("damaged" / "unverified") | Quarantine — run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Canopod.app` (see [Install](../README.md#install)). |
| `setup` fails with `notsup` / wrong Node | The project needs a newer Node than your default. Canopod uses the worktree's pinned Node (`.tool-versions`/`.nvmrc`); make sure that version is installed. |
| Server can't find `@tooljet/plugins/dist/server` | Plugins must be built per worktree — add `npm --prefix plugins install && npm --prefix plugins run build` to `setup`. |
| Frontend hits the wrong API port | The frontend bakes the server URL from `TOOLJET_SERVER_PORT` at launch — set it in `env` to `${WT_SERVER_PORT}`, and give the frontend `--port $PORT`. |
| Snapshot/export/restore fails on version | Install the Postgres version matching your server's major version. |
| A service shows as stopped but a port is in use | Another worktree (or a stale process) holds the port. Stop the other worktree, or edit this service's port. |

For anything deeper, see [features.md](features.md) (what each control does) and
[configuration.md](configuration.md) (where each setting lives).

## Terminal, logs and notifications in 0.5.0

Use **⌘1** for Logs, **⌘2** for Terminal, or **⌘3** for Terminal + logs. Terminal holds shell and agent sessions together. Its single **+** menu offers **Start agent** and **Open terminal**. With one agent profile, Start agent launches directly; multiple profiles open a chooser. The empty state offers the same two actions. **Logs alongside** keeps service output next to the selected session, and the divider supports mouse and keyboard resizing. Sessions and filters survive switching views.

Click **Needs you** to see saved notifications and setup reminders. Each can be dismissed individually or with **Clear notifications**. Setup dismissal lasts for the current app session and does not run setup or mark it successful. A changed outcome can reappear. Live crashes and waiting agents remain until their underlying condition is resolved.

In Settings → Files, select a file from the list to edit its path, format, source, values and lifecycle commands. JSON preview wraps long lines and uses a wider panel. Save all and Discard all apply to the displayed drafts; leaving with edits asks how to handle them.

Service status uses theme-colored dots. Extra services and database tools are under **⋯**. Database restore starts by choosing a dump, then a fresh destination or an existing database to replace. Replacement requires acknowledgement; restore failures appear in the attention queue. Reset offers **Run in background** while busy.
