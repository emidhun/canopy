description: A monorepo with submodules, a plugins build and a strict Node pin. Three common failure modes, and how to avoid them.

# Example: the ToolJet monorepo

ToolJet is the repository Canopy was developed against, and it exercises the harder parts: a monorepo
with a separate frontend and server, git submodules with their own tracked branches, a plugins package
that has to be built per worktree, and an `engine-strict` Node pin.

## Services

| id | name | kind | command | cwd | basePort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frontend` | Frontend | `web` | `npm start -- --port $PORT` | `frontend` | 8082 |
| `server` | Server | `server` | `npm run start:dev` | `server` | 3000 |

The frontend takes its own port from `$PORT`. The server reads `PORT` from the worktree's `.env`.

## `.worktreemanager.json`

```json
{
  "$schema": "canopy://worktree-manager/v1",
  "provision": [
    {
      "path": ".env",
      "format": "dotenv",
      "keys": {
        "PG_DB": "${WT_DB_NAME}",
        "PORT": "${WT_SERVER_PORT}",
        "TOOLJET_SERVER_PORT": "${WT_SERVER_PORT}",
        "TOOLJET_HOST": "http://localhost:${WT_FRONTEND_PORT}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "setup": [
    "npm install",
    "npm --prefix plugins install && npm --prefix plugins run build",
    "npm --prefix frontend install",
    "npm --prefix server install",
    "npm run db:create && npm run db:migrate"
  ],
  "migrate": ["npm run db:migrate"],
  "teardown": ["npm run db:drop"]
}
```

## Three common failure modes

### 1. `TOOLJET_SERVER_PORT` is baked at launch

The frontend works out the server URL from `process.env.TOOLJET_SERVER_PORT` when webpack starts,
falling back to 3000. Leave it out of the worktree's `.env` and every worktree's UI talks to the main
checkout's server, which looks like a database bug and isn't one.

So `TOOLJET_SERVER_PORT` comes from the provisioned `.env` as `${WT_SERVER_PORT}`, while the frontend's
own port comes from `--port $PORT` in its command. Two mechanisms, both required.

### 2. Plugins have to be built per worktree

The server imports `@tooljet/plugins/dist/server`. A worktree that skipped the plugins build fails its
migrations with `Cannot find module @tooljet/plugins/dist/server`, which reads like a database problem
and is a build-order problem. That's why the second setup step comes before the frontend and server
installs.

### 3. Node 22, strictly

ToolJet's server is `engine-strict` on Node 22.15.1. If your version manager's global default is older,
`npm install` fails with `notsup`.

Canopy handles this without configuration. It reads the worktree's `.nvmrc`, `.node-version` or
`.tool-versions`, finds that version's bin directory in asdf, nvm or fnm, and prepends it to `PATH` for
every command it runs in that worktree: setup, services, migrate, reset, teardown, custom commands. Make
sure the pinned version is installed:

```sh
asdf install nodejs 22.15.1     # or nvm install 22.15.1
```

## Submodules

ToolJet carries submodules, and `.gitmodules` tracks a branch for at least one of them (something like
`branch = lts-3.16`). Two operations, kept distinct:

| Action | What it does | When you want it |
|---|---|---|
| **Pull** (status bar) | `git pull --ff-only`, then advances each submodule: pulled if it's on a branch, moved to its pinned branch tip if `.gitmodules` names one, else synced to the recorded commit. | Getting up to date. |
| **Sync submodules** (`⇧⌘S`) | `git submodule sync` + `update --init --recursive`, putting every submodule back on the commit the parent pins. | After switching the parent's branch, when submodules sit on the wrong commit. |

The pull popover's caret gives you per-submodule control: a status dot, its branch or `detached <sha>`,
an **ahead of pin** marker, a branch switcher, and its own pull button.

!shot pull-menu | Per-submodule state and control, from the status bar.

Worktree creation initialises submodules with `--reference` against the main checkout, so a new worktree
doesn't re-clone them. That matters when they're large.

## Suggested commands

| Label | Group | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | Checks | `npm run lint` |
| Unit tests | Checks | `npm test -- --run` |
| Build plugins | Build | `npm --prefix plugins run build` |
| Open DB | — | `psql $WT_DB_NAME` |

The first row gets its own button in the service rail, and the rest collapse into the **Commands** menu
under their group headings.

## Databases

With repository id `tooljet`, a worktree folder `feat_history_state` gives `tooljet_feat_history_state`.
Every worktree points at the same Postgres server and differs only in database name.

:::warn Match your `pg_dump` to the server
Snapshot and export need Postgres client binaries of the same major version as the server. Canopy asks
the server and prefers `Postgres.app/Versions/<major>/bin`, but that version has to be installed. A 14
client can't dump a 16 server, and a 17 client emits a dump a 16 server rejects.

## A typical day

1. **Sync** in the top bar, which rescans worktrees and reconciles anything deleted on disk.
2. Select the branch you're on and press `⏎` to start frontend and server on its own ports.
3. Status bar **Pull**, then the database dialog's **Run migration** when migrations landed upstream.
4. `⌘2` to put the agent beside the logs, ⋯ → **Context…** to give it the issue and the acceptance
   criteria, then **Start agent**.
5. Review with the status bar's **uncommitted** chip → **Commit**.
6. When the branch merges: ⋯ → **Remove worktree…**, keeping **Drop database** ticked.
