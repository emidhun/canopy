# Your first worktree

The whole loop once through, with what happens behind each click. It assumes you've registered a
repository already ([Onboarding](onboarding.html)).

## 1. Open the New worktree dialog

`⌘N`, or **New worktree** at the bottom of the sidebar, or `⌘K → New worktree`, or the button in the
popover footer.

!shot modal-new-worktree | New worktree: pick a repository, then a new branch off a base, or an existing ref.

## 2. Choose the branch

There are two modes. **New branch** takes a name and a base to fork from; the **Created from** picker
searches local branches, remote branches and tags. **Existing** takes a ref that's already there.
Branches checked out in another worktree show up disabled, because git won't check the same branch out
twice.

**Fetch all** refreshes refs first with `git fetch --all --prune --recurse-submodules`, then tells you
what it found: *"Fetched — 14 local, 62 remote, 9 tags"*.

Your pick becomes a git operation like this:

| You picked | Canopy asks git for |
|---|---|
| New branch `feat/x` from `main` | create `feat/x` from `main` |
| Existing local branch `feat/x` | check out `feat/x` (no branch creation) |
| Remote `origin/feat/x` | a local `feat/x` tracking it, reusing the local branch if one exists |
| Tag `v1.2.0` | a local branch named `v1.2.0` created from `refs/tags/v1.2.0` |

That last pair matters. `git worktree add <path> origin/foo` checks the remote-tracking ref out
detached, so Canopy always resolves to a real local branch.

## 3. Read the destination panel

**You'll get** shows the path the worktree will land at, worked out the same way the backend works it
out: the repo's configured worktree directory (absolute, or relative to the repo, defaulting to
`<repo>/.worktrees`), plus the branch name sanitised. Letters, digits, `-` and `.` survive; everything
else becomes `_`; case is preserved. `Feature/Foo` becomes `Feature_Foo`.

Ports and database say "assigned at creation", because the backend derives them and the dialog would
only be guessing.

## 4. Optional: fill in the agent handoff

!shot modal-new-worktree-handoff | The agent handoff is collapsed by default: a PR link, an issue link, and what each one is about.

Anything you type here seeds the worktree's context. That becomes `.canopy/context.md` when you launch
an agent, and you can copy it as a PR body later. Most worktrees don't need it.

## 5. Create it

**Create worktree** (`⌘⏎`) kicks off a job the backend owns:

1. `git worktree add` at the resolved path.
2. Submodules initialised and updated, sharing objects with the main checkout through `--reference`.
3. A port index assigned (or reused) and the worktree's variables computed.
4. Provisioned files seeded and templated (`.env` and anything else in `provision`).
5. `setup` commands run in order, on the worktree's pinned toolchain.

Progress streams into the dialog. Two things to know: **Run in background** dismisses the dialog and
lets the job finish, with an in-progress row in the sidebar showing the live step and the outcome
landing in **Needs you** either way. And a failure is recorded as a notice even while the dialog is
open, so it can't disappear along with it.

## 6. Provision again later, if you need to

The ⋯ menu's **Run setup…** re-runs the same provisioning on an existing worktree, after a dependency
change or a first run that failed. The runner lists the ordered steps it parsed from the backend's
`[k/n]:` markers. If you use "Run in background" and then reopen it, it attaches to the run already in
flight instead of starting a second one.

## 7. Start the services

Press `⏎` (the next action will read **Start services**), click the button in the worktree bar, or use
the play button on the sidebar row.

!shot main-rail | The service rail: one chip per service with its port, live CPU and memory, and a start/stop control.

Each service is spawned through your login shell, in its own process group, in its configured
directory, with `$PORT` set to its own effective port and every worktree variable exported. Clicking a
chip's port opens `http://localhost:<port>`.

## 8. Read the logs

The Logs pane merges every service's output into one time-ordered stream, tagged per service. Filter
by service, filter by level, search, and toggle Follow.

!shot logs-filters | The level filter: Errors, Warnings and Info, with `ok` lines folded into Info.

If a service exits, a bar appears above the stream with **Jump to error** (which filters to that
service, shows errors only, and scrolls to the end) and **Restart**.

## 9. Work in the worktree

- **Open in editor** from the icon in the worktree bar, using the editor command from settings.
- **Terminal**: `⌘4` or `⌘5` for the terminal layouts, or the sidebar row's terminal button. It's a real
  login shell in the worktree, on its pinned toolchain.
- **Agent**: `⌘3`, then **Start agent**. Canopy writes `.canopy/context.md` first, then runs your agent
  CLI with a composed prompt. See [Terminals and agents](agents-terminals.html).
- **Pull** from the status bar. The caret opens per-submodule control.
- **Uncommitted changes**: the status bar's dirty chip opens commit, stash or discard.

## 10. Clean up

⋯ → **Remove worktree…**

!shot modal-remove-worktree | Remove worktree: a dirty precheck, then two explicit choices.

The dirty precheck runs first and fails closed. If it can't read the status, removal stays disabled
rather than claiming the tree is clean. **Drop database** is on by default, since the database belongs
to this worktree. **Also delete the branch** is off by default, and warns you when the branch has
commits that aren't on origin.

Canopy stops the services, runs `teardown`, removes the worktree with `--force`, optionally deletes the
branch, then prunes. Like create, it can run in the background.

:::tip Cheaper than a new worktree
If you only need a look at another branch and the dependencies are the same, use **Switch branch**
(`⌘\`). It reuses everything already installed, so setup takes about no time. Uncommitted changes come
with you, which the dialog warns about.
