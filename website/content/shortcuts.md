# Keyboard shortcuts

Every command in Canopy can be reached from the keyboard. Below is the complete list of bindings that
have a listener behind them. The app ships the same table in **Settings → Shortcuts**, where you can
filter it.

!shot settings-shortcuts | Settings → Shortcuts: the same reference, searchable.

On Windows and Linux, read `⌘` as `Ctrl`. The handlers accept either modifier.

## Global

| Command | Keys |
|---|---|
| Command palette | `⌘K` |
| New worktree | `⌘N` |
| Add repository | `⇧⌘N` |
| Toggle the worktree list | `⌘B` |
| Cross-worktree overview | `⌘O` |
| Settings | `⌘,` |
| Increase text size | `⌘+` |
| Decrease text size | `⌘-` |
| Reset text size | `⌘0` |

## Worktree

| Command | Keys |
|---|---|
| Run the next action | `⏎` |
| Switch branch | `⌘\` |
| Sync submodules | `⇧⌘S` |
| Runtime layout | `⌘1` |
| Split logs + agent | `⌘2` |
| Agent layout | `⌘3` |
| Terminal + logs layout | `⌘4` |
| Terminal layout | `⌘5` |

## Pull menu

| Command | Keys |
|---|---|
| Pull everything (worktree + submodules) | `⌘⏎` |
| Sync submodules | `⇧⌘S` |

## Dialogs

| Command | Keys |
|---|---|
| Confirm the primary action | `⌘⏎` |
| Confirm a simple prompt (a single named field) | `⏎` |
| Close the dialog | `Esc` |

Which of `⏎` and `⌘⏎` a dialog uses isn't arbitrary. A dialog whose only field is a name commits on
`⏎`. A dialog with prose fields or several inputs takes `⌘⏎`, so a stray `⏎` in a textarea can't fire
something destructive.

## Lists and menus

| Command | Keys |
|---|---|
| Move through a list | `↑` `↓` |
| Choose the highlighted row | `⏎` |
| Close a menu or popover | `Esc` |

## The worktree list

| Command | Keys |
|---|---|
| Add to the selection | `⌘`-click |
| Select a range | `⇧`-click |

## Settings

| Command | Keys |
|---|---|
| Search all settings | `⌘F` |
| Save changes | `⌘S` |
| Toggle the `.worktreemanager.json` preview | `⌘P` |

`⌘P` only does anything on a repository page, where there's a config file to preview.

## The menu-bar window

| Command | Keys |
|---|---|
| Focus the filter field | `⌘K` |
| New worktree | `⌘N` |
| Settings | `⌘,` |
| Start or focus the highlighted worktree | `⏎` |
| Clear the filter | `Esc` |

## How conflicts are avoided

A few rules the app follows, worth knowing if a key seems dead:

- **A dialog owns the keyboard.** `⌘N` and `⌘,` stand down while a dialog is open, so you never get a
  new surface stacked behind one, with two scrims and no way to tell which has focus.
- **`⏎` never steals from typing.** The next-action binding is skipped when focus is in an input,
  textarea, contenteditable, or a terminal.
- **Text zoom always works**, even inside a field or with the palette open, since `⌘+`, `⌘-` and `⌘0`
  can't collide with text entry.
- **Onboarding binds `⌘N` itself** for its add-repository screen, so the main window's `⌘N` stands down
  while onboarding is up.
- **`⌘\` obeys its setting.** Turn *Show the Switch-branch action* off and the shortcut does nothing
  too, otherwise turning the feature off would only hide the button.

Shortcuts aren't remappable yet, and Settings → Shortcuts says so under the table.
