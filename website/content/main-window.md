# The main window

One shell, five fixed regions. Nothing floats except dialogs and popovers.

!shot main-worktree | The main window in the Runtime layout: top bar, sidebar, worktree bar, service rail, logs, status bar.

## Top bar

!shot main-topbar | The top bar: breadcrumb, command palette, running count, attention queue, Sync and Settings.

| Element | What it does |
|---|---|
| Brand | The Canopy mark and name. The bar is also the window's drag region. |
| Breadcrumb | `repository › branch` for the selected worktree. Hidden in the overview. |
| **⌘K** button | Opens the [command palette](palette-overview.html). |
| `N running` chip | Total running services across every worktree. Click it for the overview. |
| Agents chip | Appears when an agent session is running. Click for the overview. |
| **Needs you** / **All clear** | The attention queue. Goes red when something crashed or a background job failed. |
| **Sync** | Rescans worktrees and reconciles ones deleted on disk. See below. |
| **Settings** | Opens [Settings](settings-platform.html) (`⌘,`). |

### What Sync does

More than a refresh:

1. `refresh` has the backend rediscover worktrees, git metadata and services.
2. Open views are told to re-read each repo's `.worktreemanager.json`, so edits made outside the app
   show up in Settings under Setup, Files and Migrate.
3. It lists **prunable** worktrees, meaning ones whose folders were deleted outside Canopy, and opens
   the prune dialog if it finds any. Canopy snapshots the tree before refreshing, because a vanished
   worktree's database name lived in its now-deleted `.env` and that snapshot is the last place it
   exists.

## Sidebar

!shot main-sidebar | The sidebar: worktrees grouped by state, with quick actions on each row.

The **Filter** field matches branch and repository name. A **repository filter** appears once you have
two or more repositories, ending in **Add repository… ⇧⌘N** below a rule. **All worktrees** switches to
the [overview](palette-overview.html) (`⌘O`).

A worktree being created has no row in the tree yet, so it gets its own in-progress row showing the
live setup step. Same when one is being removed.

Rows are grouped into **Needs you**, **Pinned**, **Running** and **Idle**. Each group collapses and
shows a count. A finished background job is news rather than a demand, so it never drags its worktree
into Needs you.

Each row carries:

| Part | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Status dot | green = every service running · amber = some live · red = a service crashed · faint = idle |
| Branch | Monospace, the row's identity. |
| Dirty pip | Uncommitted changes in the worktree. |
| Agent pip | Running agent sessions, with a count past one. |
| Pin | Pinned to the top group. |
| Quick actions | Start/stop all, open terminal, open in editor, pin, without opening the worktree. |

To select several: `⌘`-click toggles a row, `⇧`-click extends a range, and a plain click clears the
multi-selection. With a selection active the footer turns into **N selected · Clear · Delete N**, which
opens the multi-remove dialog.

`⌘B` hides and shows the sidebar. Hidden, a toggle appears in the worktree bar, flush against the edge
the sidebar just left.

## Worktree bar

One line, and the branch is the only part that stretches:

| Element | Notes |
|---|---|
| Branch and fork glyph | Hover for the full worktree path. |
| Git chips | `↑ahead`, `↓behind`, `●` dirty. |
| Open in editor | Uses the editor command from General settings. |
| ⋯ menu | See below. |
| The reason | A lowercase fragment explaining the button beside it. First thing to give way on a narrow window. |
| **Next action** | One button, named for what it will do. See [The next action](next-action.html). |

!shot worktree-menu | The worktree ⋯ menu: git operations, then file locations, then Remove worktree.

In the ⋯ menu, in order:

- **Switch branch…** `⌘\`, if it's enabled in General settings.
- **Pull**, the worktree and its submodules.
- **Sync submodules** `⇧⌘S`, re-pinning submodules to the commit this worktree records.
- **Run setup…** for the provisioning runner.
- **Database…** for the [database tools](databases.html).
- **Context…** for the [agent context editor](agents-terminals.html).
- **Reveal in Finder** and **Copy path**.
- **Remove worktree…**, in red, and absent on the main checkout.

## Service rail

Everything the old service cards used to say, in one 34px row.
[Services and ports](services-ports.html) covers it in full.

!shot main-rail | The service rail: running services as filled chips, then the database chip and custom commands.

## Work surface

The middle of the window is one or two panes, and each can show **Logs**, **Terminal** or **Agent**.
Layout presets are a keystroke each:

| Preset | Keys | Panes |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | `⌘1` | Logs |
| Split | `⌘2` | Logs + Agent |
| Agent | `⌘3` | Agent |
| Shell | `⌘4` | Terminal + Logs |
| Terminal | `⌘5` | Terminal |

!shot layout-split | The split layout (⌘2): logs on the left, the agent pane on the right, with a draggable divider.

Swapping a pane's tab always works. If what you end up with isn't one of the five presets, the status
bar calls it **Custom**. The divider drags between 22% and 78%.

## Status bar

!shot main-statusbar | The status bar: branch, git state, the last commit, and the Pull control with its submodule menu.

| Element | What it does |
|---|---|
| Branch | Opens **Switch branch** when that action is enabled, otherwise it's plain text. |
| `↑a ↓b` | Ahead and behind origin. |
| **uncommitted** | Opens the [commit / stash / discard](worktrees.html) dialog. |
| Last commit | Relative time and subject. |
| **Pull** + caret | Pull everything, or open the per-submodule popover. |
| Agent chip | `agent working` or `agent waiting`. |
| Layout | The current preset's name. Click to cycle (`⌘1`–`⌘5`). |
| Bell | The attention queue count. |

In the overview the bar shrinks to `All worktrees · N worktrees · M repositories` plus the bell.

## Empty states

Every region has one, and each ends on a next step instead of an apology:

- **No repositories yet**, with a button into the add-repository screen.
- **No services configured for this worktree**, said by the rail, while the logs pane offers the next
  action instead of an empty stream.
- **No agent running here** and **No terminal open here**, each with a line about what starting one
  gives you.

## Text zoom

`⌘+` and `⌘-` move the app's whole type ramp in 10% steps between 80% and 160%. `⌘0` resets it. It
applies live in every Canopy window and it persists.

!shot zoom | The main window at 130% text zoom.
