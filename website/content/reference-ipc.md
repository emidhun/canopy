description: Every command the frontend can call and every event it can receive, for when you're reading or extending the code.

# Commands and events

The frontend talks to the Rust backend through Tauri's `invoke`, and receives pushed state through
events. This is the whole surface, which is useful when you're reading the code or extending it. The
typed wrappers live in `src/ipc.ts`, the handlers in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`.

## What the UI receives

```text
RepoNode      { repoId, name, path, worktrees: WorktreeNode[] }
WorktreeNode  { wtKey, branch, path, isMain, git | null, dbName | null, services: ServiceNode[] }
ServiceNode   { svcKey, serviceId, name, kind, port | null, status }
GitMeta       { ahead, behind, dirty, lastCommitTs, lastCommitMsg }

wtKey  = the worktree's absolute path
svcKey = `${wtKey}::${serviceId}`
status ∈ stopped | starting | running | stopping | error
kind   ∈ web | server | worker
```

| `show_main_window` | `() → void` |
| `quit_app` | `() → void` |

## Events

Pushed from Rust to whichever windows are listening. High-volume events are filtered to the windows
that consume them, and suppressed entirely while every window is hidden.

| Event | Payload | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tree:changed` | `RepoNode[]` | A structural change: repo, worktree, service or settings. |
| `service:status` | `{svcKey, status, startedAt?, exitCode?}` | A service's lifecycle moved. |
| `service:log` | `{svcKey, lines[]}` | Batched log lines, every ~200 ms. |
| `service:stats` | `{entries: [{svcKey, cpu, memMb, uptimeSec}]}` | The 2-second stats poll. |
| `worktree:git` | `{wtKey, ahead, behind, dirty, lastCommitTs, lastCommitMsg}` | Git metadata refreshed. |
| `reset:status` | `{wtKey, state, message?}` | Database reset progress. |
| `worktree:op` | `{wtKey, op, state, detail}` | create / remove / setup / migrate / snapshot progress, carrying the `[k/n]:` step markers. |
| `terminal:data` | `{id, data (base64), seq}` | Raw PTY bytes. |
| `terminal:exit` | `{id}` | A session's process ended. |
| `tray:new-worktree` · `tray:overview` · `tray:settings` | — | Emitted by the popover for the main window to act on. |

## Errors

Every command rejects with a structured error:

```ts
{ code: "git" | "db" | "setup" | "process" | "terminal" | "config"
       | "not_found" | "invalid_input" | "conflict" | "internal",
  message: string }
```

The frontend reads it with `errText()` and `errCode()` instead of `String(e)`, so a plugin's
plain-string rejection and a backend error both come out useful.

## Detecting the backend

`hasBackend()` checks for `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` on `window`. It's false in a plain browser, which is
what enables [mock mode](dev-setup.html#mock-mode), and why features that need the
backend say so with a toast instead of failing silently.
