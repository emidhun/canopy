# Run every branch at once

Canopy checks each branch out as its own worktree, gives it its own database and its own ports, and
runs it. Three branches, three apps, all up at the same time. No stashing, no reinstalling, no port
arithmetic.

## What Canopy does

<div class="cards">
<a class="card" href="worktrees.html"><b>A worktree per branch</b><span>Create one from any branch or tag. Canopy installs it, migrates it, and hands it back ready to run.</span></a>
<a class="card" href="services-ports.html"><b>Ports that don't collide</b><span>Every worktree gets a stable index, and every service a port derived from it. Run five branches, nothing fights.</span></a>
<a class="card" href="databases.html"><b>Its own database</b><span>One database per worktree, named after the branch. Snapshot it, switch it, reset it, drop it on delete.</span></a>
<a class="card" href="agents-terminals.html"><b>Agents that know where they are</b><span>Launch a coding agent with the branch, ports, database and your task already written down for it.</span></a>
</div>

## Getting started

One command:

```sh
brew install --cask emidhun/canopy/canopy   # or grab the DMG
```

Open Canopy from the menu bar, point it at a repository, and it reads your `package.json` to work out
what to run. Then `⌘N` for a branch, `⏎` to start it.

<div class="cards">
<a class="card" href="onboarding.html"><b>Add your first repo →</b><span>What detection finds, what it proposes, and what it writes to disk.</span></a>
<a class="card" href="first-worktree.html"><b>Your first worktree →</b><span>Create, provision, run, open, and clean up. The whole loop once through.</span></a>
</div>

## Where to go next

**New to Canopy?** [What Canopy is](overview.html) explains the idea in about a minute, then
[Install on macOS](install-macos.html) gets it running.

**Setting it up for a repository?** [.worktreemanager.json](config-worktreemanager.html) is the file that
makes setup travel with the branch, and [Template variables](config-variables.html) lists everything
you can reference in it. There are worked configs for a
[Node + Postgres app](example-node-postgres.html), the [ToolJet monorepo](example-tooljet.html), and
[Rails, Django, Go and Rust](example-other-stacks.html).

**Using it day to day?** [The main window](main-window.html) covers every region,
[The next action](next-action.html) explains the one button that's usually right, and
[Keyboard shortcuts](shortcuts.html) is the whole map.

**Something not working?** [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.html) is symptom, cause, fix.

**Working on Canopy itself?** [Building from source](dev-setup.html) and
[Building a release](prod-setup.html).

## Scope of this documentation

This documentation was written from the app's source, for version **0.4.7**. Some screens exist with
no backend behind them yet. Those are marked *coming soon* here, exactly as the app marks them, and
[Limitations](limitations.html) lists every one with its issue number. Nothing on these pages
describes something the build can't do.
