# Databases

Each worktree gets its own database, so branches don't share data or migration state. The isolation
comes from the worktree's `.env`, not from separate servers.

## How the name is built

```
WT_DB_NAME = <repo slug>_<worktree slug>
```

The repo slug is the repository id, lowercased, with every non-alphanumeric character turned into `_`.
The worktree slug is the worktree's folder name, put through the same treatment.

Repository `tooljet` with a worktree folder `feature_x` gives `tooljet_feature_x`. A folder named
`feat-history-state` gives `tooljet_feat_history_state`.

You put that name to work in your provisioning config:

```jsonc
{
  "provision": [
    { "path": ".env", "format": "dotenv", "keys": { "PG_DB": "${WT_DB_NAME}" } }
  ]
}
```

## How isolation works

Every worktree points at the same Postgres server, with the same host, port, user and password copied
from the main checkout's `.env` when the worktree was seeded. Only the database **name** differs.
Switching database is then just rewriting `PG_DB` and restarting the services that read it.

Connection settings come from the worktree's `.env`:

| Key | Default if unset |
|---|---|
| `PG_DB` | required; without it the database features report that it isn't set |
| `PG_HOST` | `localhost` |
| `PG_PORT` | `5432` |
| `PG_USER` | `postgres` |
| `PG_PASS` | none, and no `PGPASSWORD` is injected |

## The database dialog

Open it from the rail's database chip, or ⋯ → **Database…**

!shot modal-database | The database dialog: the switcher, then snapshot, export, restore, and reset.

### Switch database

A searchable list of every database on the server. Picking one rewrites `PG_DB` in the worktree's
`.env`, restarts its server service, and confirms in the past tense: *"Now using tj_main"*.

### Save snapshot…

A name prompt, defaulting to `<db>_snap_<YYYYMMDD>_<HHMM>`, that clones the current database as it
stands right now. `⏎` commits the name. It's a copy, not a managed list, so restore it later by
switching to it or through the export/restore pair.

### Export to file…

`pg_dump` into a `.dump` file you choose in a native save dialog.

### Restore from file…

Reads a dump from disk into the current database:

| File | Command used |
|---|---|
| `.dump`, `.backup` | `pg_restore --clean` |
| `.sql` | `psql` |

### Run migration

The primary button. It runs the repo's **Migrate command** from Settings, or the `migrate` array from
`.worktreemanager.json` if that's empty.

### Reset database

Set apart as destructive. It runs the repo's **Reset command**, which by convention drops and re-seeds.
Its progress arrives as events, so the dialog and the tray popover both show it running.

## While a job runs

Only one database job runs at a time. They all take the worktree's operation lease in the backend, so
offering a second would only get you a *busy* error. The dialog stays open until the job finishes,
because these take seconds to minutes, and the footer's dismiss button becomes **Run in background**.
Use it and the outcome reports into **Needs you** with the error and log tail, named for the job that
failed: *"Snapshot failed"*, *"Database reset failed"*.

## Postgres client versions

The dump and restore tooling has to match your server's major version. Canopy handles that instead of
leaving it to `PATH`:

1. It asks the live server for `server_version_num`.
2. It prefers `Postgres.app/Versions/<major>/bin`, then a Homebrew install of that major version.
3. It falls back to the newest installed version, and finally to whatever is on `PATH`.

:::warn Why "just use PATH" fails
A `pg_dump` older than the server refuses to dump it. A newer one is wrong too: a 17 dump emits a
PG17-only `SET transaction_timeout` and an archive format that a 16 server's `pg_restore` rejects.
Matching the major version is the only thing that works reliably.
:::

Each Postgres CLI invocation is capped at 15 minutes, so a hung server can't wedge the app forever.
They run through a non-login shell, since Canopy composes the command lines itself and they only need
`PATH`, with `PGPASSWORD` injected when `PG_PASS` is set.

## Reset from the menu bar

A serving worktree's row in the popover includes a database button that runs the same reset, with the
spinner and the completion toast. Useful when you don't need the main window.

## Limits

Switch, snapshot, export, restore and reset assume **Postgres**. Another database still works fine as a
service; these particular actions just don't apply to it.

There's no snapshot list, because snapshots are databases on the server that you named. And the
database chip and dialog only appear once a worktree actually has a `PG_DB` in its `.env`.
