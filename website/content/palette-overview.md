# Palette and overview

Two cross-worktree surfaces. One to do something, one to see everything.

## The command palette (⌘K)

!shot palette | The command palette: suggested actions first, then worktrees, then commands.

Open it with `⌘K`, or the search button in the top bar. `⌘K` again closes it, and so does `Esc`.

### Suggested

With an empty query, the first section is whatever the current state implies:

1. The selected worktree's next action, with its reason.
2. Up to three rows from the attention queue, phrased as imperatives: *"Restart — API crashed"*.

Those rows call the same runner the worktree bar's button does, so `⌘K` can't disagree with the rest
of the app. Notices are left out on purpose: every palette row performs something, and a row that did
nothing when picked would be the odd one out.

### Worktrees

Every worktree, monospaced, with its status dot and repository name. Typing filters on branch and
repository. Picking one selects it.

### Actions

| Row | Effect |
|---|---|
| Start all services | Starts every worktree of every repository. |
| Stop all services | Stops every worktree. |
| New worktree | Opens the create dialog. |
| Add repository (`⇧⌘N`) | Opens the add-repository screen. |
| Pull all worktrees | Pulls each worktree in turn. |
| Start agent here | Launches an agent in the selected worktree and switches to the Agent layout. |
| Open terminal here | Opens a shell in the selected worktree and switches to a terminal layout. |
| Layout: Runtime / Split logs + agent / Agent / Terminal + logs / Terminal | `⌘1`–`⌘5`. |
| All worktrees (`⌘O`) | The overview. |
| Settings | Opens Settings. |

Navigate with `↑` `↓`, run the highlighted row with `⏎`, close with `Esc`. The footer restates that and
shows the result count. Hovering a row moves the highlight too, so mouse and keyboard stay in
agreement.

## The overview (⌘O)

!shot overview | Every worktree in one table: attention first, then running, then idle.

Open it with `⌘O`, the top bar's `N running` chip, the sidebar's **All worktrees** row, or the palette.
`⌘O` toggles back.

Three sections in fixed order: **Needs you**, **Running**, **Idle**. Each is a table sharing one
geometry, so the columns line up down the whole page.

| Column | Contents |
|---|---|
| Worktree | Status dot and branch. |
| Repo | Repository name. |
| Services | A pip per service (filled = live, red = crashed) and `live/total`. |
| Agent | `working`, `waiting`, or `—`. |
| CPU | Summed across live services only. |
| Memory | Same. |
| Size | Not measured yet, see below. |
| Git | `↓behind ↑ahead ●dirty`, or `clean`. |
| Actions | The worktree's next action, and a terminal button. |

Clicking a row opens that worktree. The header carries live totals (`N/M services`, the agent count,
how many need you) plus **Start all** and **Stop all**.

:::note Not measured yet
The **Size** column always reads `—`. Nothing in the backend measures a worktree's on-disk footprint.
The column stays so the table geometry matches the design and wiring it up is purely additive
([issue #55](https://github.com/emidhun/canopy/issues/55)).

## Choosing between them

Know what you want to do? `⌘K`. Want to know what's going on? `⌘O`. Want the one thing this worktree
needs? `⏎`.
