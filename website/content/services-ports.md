# Services and ports

A **service** is a long-running process for one worktree: a frontend dev server, an API, a worker. You
define the command once per repository, and Canopy runs one copy per worktree on that worktree's own
port.

## Defining a service

Per repository, in [Settings → Services](settings-repository.html):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable identifier (`frontend`, `server`). Part of the service key and of the port variable name. |
| `name` | Display name. Also exposed as a port variable, so `${WT_SERVER_PORT}` works for a service named "Server" whatever its id is. |
| `kind` | `web`, `server` or `worker`. The web service is what "Open :port" targets and what the popover's globe opens. |
| `command` | The shell command that starts it. Use `$PORT` for this service's own port. |
| `cwd` | Working directory relative to the worktree root. Blank means the worktree root. |
| `basePort` | The base for the port formula. Leave it empty for a service that doesn't listen. |
| `env` | Extra environment variables, `KEY=VALUE` per line. |

!shot settings-services | A service in Settings, with the derived-port hint under the base port.

## The service rail

!shot main-rail | The service rail: one row holding the services, the database and the custom commands.

Every chip carries a status dot, the name, the port, live CPU and memory while it runs, and a hover
control whose meaning depends on the state:

| Status | Dot | Hover control |
|---|---|---|
| `running` | green | **Stop** |
| `starting` / `stopping` | amber, spinner | nothing, it's busy |
| `stopped` | faint | **Start** |
| `error` | red | **Restart** |

Click the **port** to open `http://localhost:<port>`, which only works while it's running. Click the
**chip** for the service detail dialog. The rail scrolls sideways when there are a lot of services, and
the custom-command buttons sit outside the scroll area so their menu can escape it.

## Service detail

!shot modal-service | Service detail: the metric trio with a CPU sparkline, the port override, and Restart.

The **CPU sparkline** shows the last seven samples, kept on the client side since the backend streams
point-in-time stats every two seconds. Below it, **cpu / mem / uptime** for the current sample. If the
process has died, the panel is titled *Last samples before exit* and leads with the failure, its exit
code, and the last two error lines from its log.

**Port** is an explicit override for this service in this worktree. It's validated between 1024 and
65535 and checked against every other worktree's ports, so a clash tells you which branch and service
is holding it. `Esc` reverts the field, and saving restarts the service.

**Stop** appears while it's running. The primary button is **Restart**, or **Save & restart** if you
changed the port.

:::note Not shown yet
The design has a resolved-environment section here (`PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, `TOOLJET_HOST`). No IPC
exposes a service's computed environment, and guessing the values would defeat the point of the panel,
so it's left out until `service_env` lands
([issue #59](https://github.com/emidhun/canopy/issues/59)).

## The port formula

```
effective port = explicit override (if set)
                 else basePort + (worktree index × 10)
```

Every worktree has a stable index. The main checkout is always 0, so it keeps the base ports. New
worktrees take the lowest free index (1, 2, 3 and so on). Removing a worktree frees its slot and the
next worktree reclaims it, which stops derived ports creeping upwards forever. Indices live in
`state.json` per repository, so ports don't shuffle between launches, and index spaces are independent
per repository.

An override is per service per worktree and beats the formula.

For a service with `basePort: 3000`:

| Worktree | Index | Port |
|---|---|---|
| main checkout | 0 | 3000 |
| second worktree | 1 | 3010 |
| third worktree | 2 | 3020 |
| third removed, a new one created | 2 (reclaimed) | 3020 |

## Referring to ports in commands

| Variable | Where it works | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `$PORT` | A service's own command | That service's effective port. |
| `$WT_<ID>_PORT` | setup, custom commands, service environments | The port of the service with that **id**, uppercased. |
| `$WT_<NAME>_PORT` | same | The port of the service with that **name**, uppercased with non-alphanumerics as `_`. |
| `$WM_PORT_<ID>` | same | Back-compat alias. |

A frontend that has to know where the API is:

```sh
# the frontend's own command
npm start -- --port $PORT
# and in .worktreemanager.json → provision → .env keys
API_URL = http://localhost:${WT_SERVER_PORT}
```

The [Template variables](config-variables.html) page has the full list.

## Starting and stopping

| Action | Where |
|---|---|
| Start or stop one service | The rail's hover control, or the service detail dialog. |
| Restart one service | Service detail, the rail (when it has crashed), or the logs fix bar. |
| Start or stop everything in a worktree | The next-action button, the sidebar row's play/stop, the popover row, `⌘K`. |
| Start or stop **every** worktree | The overview header, or `⌘K → Start all services` / `Stop all services`. |

On start, the command runs through your login shell, so version managers initialise the way they do in
a terminal. The worktree's pinned Node (from `.nvmrc`, `.node-version` or `.tool-versions`) is located
in your asdf, nvm or fnm installs and put first on `PATH`. The process gets its own process group (a
Job Object on Windows), so stopping it takes the whole child tree with it, and `$PORT` plus every
worktree variable is exported into its environment.

On stop: `SIGTERM` to the process group, three seconds of grace, then `SIGKILL`.

## Crash recovery

Spawned process-group ids are written to `state.json`. If Canopy dies without cleaning up, the next
launch sweeps them, checking the recorded start time so an unrelated new process that reused the pid
survives. Quitting from the tray or with `⌘Q` kills every group before exit.

Only one Canopy instance runs at a time. A second launch focuses the first window and exits, because
otherwise instance B's startup sweep would kill instance A's running services and both would race on
`settings.json`.

## What each status means

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `stopped` | Not running. |
| `starting` | Spawned, not yet confirmed up. |
| `running` | Up. |
| `stopping` | `SIGTERM` sent, waiting for exit. |
| `error` | Exited unexpectedly. The exit code is kept and shown in service detail. |

A worktree's dot aggregates them: red if anything errored, green if everything runs, amber if
something is live, faint otherwise. A worktree with no services reads as idle, not as healthy.

## Custom commands

Not services. One-shot scripts, sitting beside the runtime they operate on.

!shot main-rail | The first custom command gets its own button; the rest collapse into the Commands menu.

You define them per repository as `{ label, command, group }` in
[Settings → Commands](settings-repository.html). The first one renders as its own labelled button and
the rest collapse into a **Commands** popover, with a heading per group and ungrouped commands sitting
together without one.

Each runs in the worktree root, on the pinned toolchain, through your login shell, with every
provisioning variable available. Only one runs at a time per worktree, since they share the worktree's
operation log and a second would interleave its output. Progress shows up as toasts, and the output
streams into the worktree's operation log.
