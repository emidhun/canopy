# The menu-bar popover

The popover is the fast path. Start or stop a worktree, open its app, reset its database, or jump into
the manager, without leaving whatever you were doing.

!shot popover | The popover: repository picker and summary, filter, worktrees grouped by state, footer actions, health line.

## Opening it

| Platform | How |
|---|---|
| macOS | Click the tray icon. The popover is a non-activating `NSPanel`: it doesn't steal focus, it floats over full-screen apps, and it hides when it loses key status. |
| Linux / Windows | Click the tray icon, which here is a regular borderless always-on-top window. The icon also carries a menu with **Open Canopy** and **Quit Canopy**, since Linux tray backends don't deliver click events. |

On macOS the panel is positioned by hand from the tray icon's rectangle: centred under it, hanging
below the menu bar with a small gap.

## Header

The **repository picker** shows the current repo's name, and the popover shows one repository at a
time. It's disabled when you only have one; otherwise it opens a list. Beside it, a summary reading
`N running · M total`, or just the worktree count when nothing is running. The **gear** opens Settings
(`⌘,`) by showing the main window and opening Settings there.

The **filter** matches branch names and highlights the match in the row. `⌘K` focuses it and `Esc`
clears it.

## Rows

Worktrees are grouped by state: **Running**, **Starting**, then **Idle** (titled **Matches** while
you're filtering). Each row shows:

| Part | Notes |
|---|---|
| Dot | green running · red a service crashed · amber starting · faint idle |
| Branch | An `owner/` prefix recedes visually so the meaningful tail stays readable. |
| Meta | Running: a crash count, the primary service's port, and its uptime. Idle: `N ahead`, or `idle`. Starting: `starting…` |
| Actions | Depend on the state, see below. |

The "primary" service behind the port and uptime is the first web service with a port, failing that
the first service with a port, failing that the first service.

### Row actions

| State | Actions |
|---|---|
| Running (or crashed) | **Open in browser** · **Terminal** · **Reset database** · **Stop** |
| Starting | **Terminal** · **Reset database** · **Cancel start** |
| Idle | **Open in editor** · **Terminal** · **Start** |

Clicking the row itself selects that worktree and opens the main window.

## Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` `↓` | Move the cursor through the visible rows. |
| `⏎` | Start the highlighted worktree if it's idle, otherwise focus it in the manager. |
| `⌘K` | Focus and select the filter field. |
| `⌘N` | New worktree, which shows the main window and opens the dialog there. |
| `⌘,` | Settings, same route. |
| `Esc` | Clear the filter. |
| any other key | Focuses the filter, so you can just start typing. |

Moving the mouse drops keyboard mode, so the hover highlight and the keyboard cursor never fight each
other.

## Footer

**New worktree** opens the dialog in the main window. **Open Manager** shows the main window on the
overview. **Quit** stops every service Canopy started, then exits.

Below that sits a health line reporting real state:

| Condition | Line |
|---|---|
| Any service exited unexpectedly | `N services stopped unexpectedly` (amber) |
| Something is running | `Canopy is running smoothly` (green) |
| Nothing is running | `No services running` |

The app version sits at the right of that line.

## How the popover talks to the main window

Creating a worktree, the overview and Settings all live in the main window. The popover shows that
window and emits a command (`tray:new-worktree`, `tray:overview`, `tray:settings`) which the main
window listens for and turns into the right surface. It doesn't try to reimplement those screens.
